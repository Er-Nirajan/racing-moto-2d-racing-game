DESCRIPTION:

Racing Moto is 2-D game developed using the graphics library that comes as a part of Turbo C++ IDE. The application begins with a welcome screen where an object in the shape of a bike moves across the screen until the user presses any key. Upon this, the user enters the main menu which has four options. The user can navigate between the options using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The four options available are 'New Game', 'Instructions', 'High Score' and 'Exit'. Upon selecting the 'New Game' option, the user enters the game menu. The user can control a bike. The main objective of the game is to avoid the obstacles that come in the way. The user can switch between the lanes using arrow keys on the keyboard. Three types of obstacles are present. They are human, pit-hole and bonus. The user must avoid colliding against pit-holes and humans. Upon colliding against bonus, the user's score increases by 100. The user's game ends once he collides against either a pit-hole or a human. After each level, the obstacles move faster towards the bike. Upon selecting 'Instructions' option, a screen appears alerting the user about the various rules of the game. Upon selecting the 'High Score' option, a screen appears which displays the information of the player who has had the maximum score as of now. Upon selecting the 'Exit' option, the user can quit the application.
